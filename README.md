A linear regression model is created to use audio features to predict Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (Total_UPDRS). The linear regression model is optimized with regularization parameter (lambda = 0.5). The learning rate was optimal at 0.3 and the cost function threshold for the gradient descent was 0.0001. The data was divided into a 80/20 split for training and test data. Validation data was omitted and the parameters were optimized on the training data. Though not ideal because of potential overfitting, this was proved to be not an issue once tested against the testing data. The final weights determined by the model was [ 0.006  0.15  -0.042  0.002 -0.003 -0.001 -0.003 -0.001  0.002  0.005 -0.004 -0.001  0.022 -0.004 -0.004 -0.032  0.053 -0.067  0.048] with a training error of 0.454. The test error of the model was 0.481. The training and test data was close in value and the test data was larger than the training data which proved that the model was not overfitting and optimizing the weights properly. The other notebook is to use a package to create a similar model with a similar optimization technique (regularization in this case). The optimization technique used was ridge optimization.
